# 3dof

A robotic arm made using ros2 and moveit2 with 3 degrees of freedom
Designed the model of robotic arm and simulated in gazebo along with ros control to avoid collision etc
Implemented lifecycle nodes and services to perform specific rasks
Then used moveit for implementinf inverse kinematics and perform pick and place operartions
